            My passion for coding started in college where I would watch my
            roommate dissect his code like a virtual biologist and put it all
            back together. It wasn’t until after graduation that I realized the
            seed planted by my roommate was beginning to sprout. So I started to
            teach myself and eventually found Lambda, which has been the
            fertilizer to help this passion grow from the seedling planted by my
            roommate, to the blossoming tree that it is today.

            I decided to learn to code after a talk with an experienced
            developer. He told me of the opportunities available in this field
            and that night I started learning the basics of HTML. While I first
            started this path for the monetary opportunities, I soon found that
            I truly enjoyed coding. I continued self-learning in CSS and
            Javascript and I eventually decided I wanted a boost in my studies
            so I signed up for Lambda. This has turned out to be an excellent
            decision.

            On the frontend, I did the login/signup page. We used hooks which
            were new to me but very useful! On the backend, I did testing for
            the coach-helpers-router and also the register. This was my first
            time using PostgreSQL and it was good to learn! I am 22 years old
            and have lived in Michigan my whole life. My passion is
            singing/music and I hope to start creating my own music for all to
            hear! Here at Lambda, my life has changed for the better and I am
            truly excited for my future as a Full-Stack Web Developer!
